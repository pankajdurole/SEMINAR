ABSTRACT


We are in a period of “Information Age” where the traditional industry can pressure the rapid shift to the industrial revolution for 
industrialization, based on economy of information technology Terabytes of data are produced and stored day-to day life because of fast
growth in „Information Technology‟. Terabytes of data are produced and stored day-to day life because of fast growth in „Information
Technology‟. The data which is collected is converted into knowledge by data analysis by using various combinations of algorithms. For
example: the huge amount of the data regarding the patients is generated by the hospitals such as x-ray results , lungs results ,heart
paining results, chest pain results , personal health records(PHRs) ., etc. There is no effective use of the data which is generated from
the hospitals. Some certain tools are used to extract the information from the database for the detection of heart diseases and other
functions is not accepted. The main theme of the paper is the prediction of heart diseases using machine learning techniques by
summarizing the few current researches. In this paper the logistic regression algorithms is used and the health care data which classifies
the patients whether they are having heart diseases or not according to the information in the record. Also I will try to use this data a
model which predicts the patient whether they are having heart disease or not.
